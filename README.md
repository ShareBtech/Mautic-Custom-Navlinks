# Mautic-Custom-Navlinks
 
Mautic Plugin that allows you to create custom navigation items 

Features
- Database driven navigation assembly
- Admin and Primary navigation placement with order
- Display within Mautic iframe or open in a new browser tab

Limitations
- Plugin activation is automatic, havent figured out how the plugin enable works
- individual nav items currently do not respect the ability to enable/disable
- No ability currently to control visibility by role, so turns on for all
